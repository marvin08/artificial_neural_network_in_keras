# artificial_neural_network_in_keras

This is a predictive model in keras for finding out whether a person is a bike buyer or not. The model is trained with the given dataset and then used for our predictive analysis. This deep neural network uses 2 hidden layers apart from the input and output layers. After all the iterations, the accuracy of this model is displayed. The accuracy can be altered by changing the number of layers as well as by changing the numbers of 'epochs' and 'batch_size'.
